\begin{abstract}
First and foremost, I would like to express my great gratitude to my advisors Dr. Bugra Tekin and Dr. Johannes L. Sch√∂nberger at Microsoft Research for their help this half year. They are very responsible and have provided countless advices to me during the whole period of my thesis. In this half year, we had weekly meetings regularly, and during each meeting they were responsive to the problems I was facing, gave me constructive suggestions and guided me to the potential directions with patience. The model we are using in this thesis also follows Bugra Tekin's work \cite{tekin2018real} last year.

I would like to show my special thanks to my supervisor Prof. Marc Pollefeys for offering the chance for me to work with Microsoft Research. I learnt quite a lot through this thesis  and gained both theoretical knowledge and practical experience in camera localization and object pose detection area.

I am also particularly grateful for the great help given by my friend Zuoyue Li. When I have some theoretical or implementing problems related with deep learning, Leonhard cluster, etc, he can always offer me quite valuable suggestions and help me solve the problem.

Last but not least, I would like to thank my  family especially my parents for their long-lasting spiritual and financial support throughout my studying life these years.
