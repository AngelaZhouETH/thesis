\section{SIXD}
\label{sec:SIXD}
Although SIXD tollkit can help us generate quite a lot different views of the object in random textures, the views we generated are still not realistic enough.

To adress these limitations, one of the future work we can do is to adjust the initial orientation of the 3D object model so that most of the camera views have a fixed upright direction aligned to z=1. Also, automatically filtering out some unrealistic views such as the view from the bottom of the object is also necessary. Since in real indoor environment, we rarely see the furniture from a view to the bottom of it. The random background utilized should better be of indoor environments containing recognizable furnitures. And if possible, it would be great if the floor can be detected and put the object onto floor level so that it is not obviously floating in the air.
